# CLI and work-item operations

- Identifier: MOD-CLI
- Status: Done
- Last updated: 2026-08-10

This module provides documentation checks, portal builds, local serving,
search, Git comparisons, and work-item operations. Results are reproducible,
exit codes are stable, and machine-readable reports use JSON schema v1.

## Code locations

- `api.go` and `cmd/toudocu/main.go` — public Go facade and executable entry
  point;
- `internal/app/cli.go` and `internal/app/server.go` — CLI and local server;
- `internal/app/task_context.go`, `task_ready.go`, `task_verify.go`, and
  `task_archive.go` — work-item operations;
- `internal/app/search.go` and `scaffold.go` — search and document scaffolds;
- `internal/app/command_process_*.go` — process startup and termination;
- `skills/bundle.go`, `internal/skillinstall/`, and
  `internal/app/skill_cli.go` — embedded skill, planning, and filesystem
  operations.

## Boundaries

The CLI does not interpret a natural-language request. `task ready` and
`task context` are read-only. Only `task verify --run` starts project commands,
after validating the work item and receiving separate authorization from the
user.

`$toudocu init`, `$toudocu refresh`, and `$toudocu translate` are AI-agent
workflows, not Go CLI commands. `skill` only
places embedded files and never executes their contents. The skill lifecycle is
not exported through the public Go facade.

## Business rules

### BR-CLI-001: Task context does not execute commands

`task context` returns the work item, required documents, relationships, and
diagnostics without invoking the system shell.

### BR-CLI-002: Checks are only run explicitly

`AC-*`, `ALL`, `DOCS`, and optional `QUALITY` commands run only through
`task verify --run`. An identical command runs once, and the report keeps every
target mapped to it.

### BR-CLI-003: Timeout terminates process tree

When `--timeout` expires, Toudocu stops the system shell and every child process
it created. The result is `timed_out`.

### BR-CLI-004: Toudocu does not interpret user request

Toudocu creates a neutral scaffold and validates its format. A person or agent
chooses relationships, writes requirements, changes status, and confirms
acceptance criteria.

### BR-CLI-005: Browser and CLI use the same scaffold registry

`task init`, the `scaffold` variants, and the editor use one registry for field
order, validation, target paths, and templates. A new file is created atomically
with overwrite prohibited through `O_EXCL`.

### BR-CLI-006: A translation root is not a work context

A translation root can be checked, built, searched, compared, and served
read-only. Work-item commands, `scaffold`, and Editor writes return
`TRANSLATION_ROOT_READ_ONLY` before changing data or running commands.
Translated work items are reader-facing mirrors; context and CI use the
canonical root.

### BR-CLI-007: Archiving does not change the task contract

`task archive` and `task restore` move one file without overwriting and do not
change its Markdown or status. The operation is blocked if a direct Markdown
link would resolve differently after the move.

### BR-CLI-008: A managed skill does not overwrite user changes

The lifecycle changes only an absent target or an exact managed copy with a
valid manifest. Extra, changed, or removed files, incorrect permissions,
symbolic links, unmanaged directories, corrupt manifests, and newer installed
versions block the write. There is no `--force`.

### BR-CLI-009: The skill lifecycle works offline

The canonical skill package is embedded in the binary. `skill install`,
`status`, `update`, and `uninstall` do not use the network, a system shell, or a
marketplace and do not run scripts from the package.

### BR-CLI-010: Multi-target operations are planned before writing

With `--agent all`, the CLI resolves and classifies every unique target before
writing. It then processes targets independently; one failure does not stop the
others, but a partial result returns exit code `1`.

## Invariants

- JSON output is not mixed with streaming human-readable text.
- Work-item commands run sequentially and continue after one fails.
- Every command starts from the repository root.
- At most the last 1 MiB of stdout and 1 MiB of stderr is retained per command.
- A build requires explicit `toudocu build`; a bare path is rejected.
- `init`, `refresh`, and `translate` are rejected as top-level CLI
  commands.
- Work-item and document creation never uses a translation root.
- `serve` binds to loopback by default; another address must be explicit.
- The browser opens only with `--open`; there is no `--no-open` or `--edit`.
- `skill status` is read-only. Mutating skill commands recheck the target before
  publication and restore the backup if publication fails.

## Stable interfaces

- commands and options in the [CLI contract](../contracts/cli.md);
- schema-v1 `ProjectReport`, `TaskContextReport`, `SearchReport`,
  `TaskInitReport`, `ScaffoldReport`, `TaskReadyReport`, `TaskMoveReport`, and
  `TaskVerifyReport`;
- exit code `0` only for success or an allowed no-op.
