# Installing and updating Toudocu

GitHub Release installers are the main way to install or update Toudocu. A
source build remains available for development and testing changes.

## Install or update the latest stable release

Linux and macOS:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/lumenikoly/toudocu/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/lumenikoly/toudocu/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

Running the installer again will leave a binary with the same SHA-256 digest in
place. When a newer version exists, replacement happens only after download,
checksum, and version checks succeed.

Confirm that the installed binary is available from `PATH`:

```bash
toudocu version
```

## Supported platforms

| System | Architecture | Release asset |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | AMD64 / x86-64 | `toudocu-linux-amd64` |
| Linux | ARM64 / AArch64 | `toudocu-linux-arm64` |
| macOS | Intel | `toudocu-darwin-amd64` |
| macOS | Apple silicon | `toudocu-darwin-arm64` |
| Windows | AMD64 / x86-64 | `toudocu-windows-amd64.exe` |
| Windows | ARM64 | `toudocu-windows-arm64.exe` |

On Windows ARM64, the installer selects the native ARM64 binary, including
when running from an emulated x64 process. Other unlisted combinations fail
before downloading.

## Select a version

For a POSIX shell, pass the environment variable after the pipe:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/lumenikoly/toudocu/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | TOUDOCU_VERSION=0.0.5 sh
```

PowerShell uses the same variable:

```powershell
$env:TOUDOCU_VERSION = "0.0.5"
irm https://github.com/lumenikoly/toudocu/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
Remove-Item Env:TOUDOCU_VERSION
```

The accepted formats are `X.Y.Z` and `X.Y.Z-rc.N`, without a `v` prefix. An
explicit version allows pinning, an intentional downgrade, or installation of
a specifically selected release candidate. `latest` always selects a stable
release.

## Directory and PATH

By default, the binary is installed at:

- `~/.local/bin/toudocu` on Linux and macOS;
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\toudocu\toudocu.exe` on Windows.

If that directory is not in `PATH`, the installer adds one managed entry to
`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, fish `conf.d`, `.profile`, or the Windows user `PATH`. It
cannot change the parent shell, so it prints the exact `source` command, states
that a login or re-login is required, or asks the user to open a new Windows
terminal.

Using another directory does not change the shell profile:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/lumenikoly/toudocu/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | TOUDOCU_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/bin" sh
```

`TOUDOCU_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1` disables changes to the profile or Windows user
`PATH`. In either case, the installer prints the directory that must be added
to `PATH` manually.

## Trust boundary

The HTTPS bootstrap downloads the binary and `checksums.txt` from the same
GitHub Release. It requires exactly one SHA-256 entry for the selected artifact,
compares the digest, and runs `toudocu version` before replacement. A download,
checksum, version, or staging error before replacement does not change the old
binary. A later error writing `PATH` does not roll back an already verified
binary: the installer prints a warning and a manual `PATH` hint.

The checksum protects against accidental corruption but is not an independent
cryptographic signature: the binary and checksum share the release trust root.
The `curl | sh` and `irm | iex` commands also execute a remote installer. You
can download and inspect it separately before running it.

Network access and system download/hash tools are needed only by the installer.
After installation, Toudocu remains one self-contained Go binary with no
runtime dependencies. The only optional outbound request during normal
operation is the stable-version check in the main `serve` portal; disable it
with `--no-update-check`.

## Build from source

Use this method to develop Toudocu or test changes that have not been released:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lumenikoly/toudocu.git
cd toudocu
make build
./toudocu version
```

This creates a `toudocu` binary in the working-copy root. It does not add the
binary to `PATH`; move it to your own executable directory if needed.

To build the current source and update a local binary in one command, run:

```bash
make update-local
```

By default, the target installs the result at `~/.local/bin/toudocu`. To use a
different directory, provide it explicitly:

```bash
make update-local INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/bin"
```
