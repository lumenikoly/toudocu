# Changes HTTP API: Behavior and boundaries

- Identifier: CON-CHANGES-HTTP-V1
- Status: Done
- Last updated: 2026-08-12

[OpenAPI 3.1.0](changes.openapi.yaml) defines exact routes, parameters,
response codes, and JSON schemas. This document describes what an HTTP schema
cannot express: version sources and Git read boundaries. Documentation
discussions have a separate
[agent feedback API](agent-feedback.openapi.yaml).

In the main `serve`, the specification is available through the built-in
Swagger UI.

## Availability

The Changes API exists only under `serve` and does not write anything itself.
When a translation root is served directly, the API compares that root, but
translations attached to the main portal do not receive a separate API.

Go includes the screen only when Changes is available and passes a same-origin
API address to the browser in the page's JSON block. A static build contains
neither the address nor client code.

The agent feedback API is available only in the main `serve` and does not
depend on the selected Git range: its target always points to current Markdown
in the canonical documentation root.

## Git comparison

The API reads local commits, the index, and the working tree. It does not run
`fetch` or `checkout` and does not change Git. `branchBase` computes the merge
base between the selected branch and `HEAD`; when `base` is also present, both
refs must resolve locally.

The ETag depends on the filtered result, selected range, current documentation
version, `HEAD`, Git status, and resolved refs. An index or working-tree change
therefore cannot return the old report.

The summary does not contain the complete patch. Details, full content, and
rendered Markdown are built only after a specific file is selected.

## Safe file reads

The ordinary Changes API accepts only a relative POSIX path inside an allowed
documentation root. It rejects an absolute path, `..`, backslashes, `.git`,
symbolic-link escapes, and every path outside that root.

The server chooses the response type, adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
and applies a strict content policy. Only the safe renderer converts Markdown
to HTML. SVG cannot execute scripts, load external resources, or apply inline
styles.

A Semantics, Mermaid, OpenAPI, screen-map, or asset error remains a diagnostic
for that view and does not hide the exact Git patch.

## Repository projection for Changes

`/_toudocu/api/changes/review/repository/` separately lists tracked and new
non-ignored files across the repository for the Changes interface. It uses the
same read-only Git mode but does not alter public `ChangeSetReport`, the
ordinary `changes` command, or the Go API.

Old and current full content and the patch load only on request. Go validates
the path, regular-file type, UTF-8, absence of NUL, binary format, and 2 MiB
limit. Known documentation files also receive the usual specialized views.

These routes do not write discussions. Fields and HTTP statuses are defined in
[Changes OpenAPI](changes.openapi.yaml), while local conversation writes use
the [agent feedback OpenAPI](agent-feedback.openapi.yaml).
