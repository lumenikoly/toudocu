# Third-party notices

Docu-docu is licensed under Apache-2.0. The components below are separately
licensed and retain their own copyright and license notices. Release packaging
generates one complete `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` by combining this inventory with
the notices of the embedded browser assets.

## Frontend development toolchain

TypeScript, esbuild and Playwright are pinned development dependencies used to
type-check, build and test `web/`. They are not embedded as runtime packages and
are not required by the released Go binary. Their license notices remain in the
npm dependency distributions and lockfile; only the deterministic build output
and separately listed vendored browser libraries are shipped.

## CodeMirror 6

The serve-only editor bundles `codemirror@6.0.2`,
`@codemirror/lang-markdown@6.5.1`, `@codemirror/lang-json@6.0.2`,
`@codemirror/lang-yaml@6.1.3`, `@codemirror/lang-go@6.0.1`,
`@codemirror/lang-java@6.0.2`, `@codemirror/lang-javascript@6.2.5`,
`@codemirror/lint@6.9.7`,
`@codemirror/merge@6.12.2` and their CodeMirror /
Lezer transitive packages under the MIT License. The complete license notice is
embedded as `assets/codemirror.LICENSE.txt`; release checksums are embedded as
`assets/codemirror.checksums.txt`. Node.js is used only to rebuild the vendored
IIFE bundle and is not a Go or end-user runtime dependency.

## go.yaml.in/yaml/v3

- Package: `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3`
- Version: `v3.0.5`

The package parses OpenAPI YAML for deterministic semantic comparison. It is
linked into the Docu-docu binary and does not execute input or require a runtime
service. Its source distribution contains MIT-licensed libyaml-derived files
and Apache-2.0-licensed remaining files; its copyright notices are retained in
the module source and this attribution accompanies the binary release.

## Swagger UI

- Package: `swagger-ui-dist`
- Version: `5.32.12`

- License: Apache-2.0

The canonical serve-only API documentation embeds `swagger-ui.css`,
`swagger-ui-bundle.js` and `swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js`. The upstream
license and generated bundle notices are embedded beside them as
`assets/swagger-ui*.LICENSE.txt`; `assets/swagger-ui.checksums.txt` records
their SHA-256 digests. Node.js is used only to refresh these vendored files and
is not a Go or end-user runtime dependency.

## Mermaid Tiny and bundled dependencies

embedded library. Release packaging also includes this notice as
part of the generated `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
