  Create, update, review, validate, translate, or operate Toudocu-managed project
  documentation, including the Toudocu CLI and portal, Toudocu discussions and
  the local Agent Feedback queue, explicit $toudocu workflows, and MOD-*, UC-*,
  FLOW-*, SC-*, TR-*, ADR-*, STD-*, RB-*, TASK-*, and other supported entities.
  Also use when code or product changes affect documented behavior, public
  interfaces, configuration, architecture, workflows, operational procedures,
  or user-visible behavior. Produce evidence-backed, reader-first text in the
  selected document language. Do not use for general code or text questions
  unless they require Toudocu-managed documentation or affect its accuracy,
  structure, or content. Do not use for code-only changes that explicitly
  preserve public and documented behavior. Never infer initialization or run
  `task verify --run` without explicit authorization.

# Toudocu

Toudocu maintains source Markdown, explicit relationships, and safe repository
paths. Use repository evidence to keep that documentation accurate and useful.

## Route the request

Use the first matching route. Explicit `$toudocu` operations take precedence;
do not add `workflows.md` when their operation reference already defines the
workflow.

| Request | Read | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `$toudocu init` | [references/init.md](references/init.md) | Only when explicitly invoked |
| `$toudocu refresh` or `$toudocu refresh diff` | [references/refresh.md](references/refresh.md) | Only the requested refresh mode |
| `$toudocu translate <locale>` or `$toudocu translate diff` | [references/translate.md](references/translate.md) | Only the explicitly selected locale mode |
| `$toudocu feedback`, Toudocu discussions, or the local Agent Feedback queue | [references/agent-feedback.md](references/agent-feedback.md) | Use its isolated transport and lifecycle |
| Ordinary source-documentation mutation, CLI, portal, or task operation | [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md) | Follow the requested operation |
| Read-only review, analysis, or explanation | Only the applicable references below | Skip `workflows.md` unless CLI or diagnostics are required |

Load additional references only when the request needs them:

- [references/writing-quality.md](references/writing-quality.md) when drafting,
  revising, or reviewing reader-facing prose, headings, tables, diagram labels,
  messages, or translations;
- [references/semantic-gate.md](references/semantic-gate.md) before changing
  source documentation;
- [references/document-model.md](references/document-model.md) when creating,
  selecting, or reviewing typed documents, stable IDs, or relationships;
- [references/architecture-gate.md](references/architecture-gate.md) for
  architecture documents;
- [references/screen-model.md](references/screen-model.md) for `FLOW-*`, `SC-*`,
  `TR-*`, screen states, or hotspots;
- [references/work-item-model.md](references/work-item-model.md) for `TASK-*`,
  `BUG-*`, or work-item lifecycle operations.

If Toudocu returns `DOCS_MIGRATION_REQUIRED`, read `Migration` from the
diagnostic and open `references/migrations/<Migration>.md`. Apply that guide
only to canonical documentation, set the guide's target
`documentationVersion` before validation, run `toudocu check`, and fix the
remaining migration-related errors. Preserve unrelated information and never
invent a value that project evidence cannot establish. After the check passes,
continue with the ordinary current-format workflow.

## Preserve global invariants

1. Give repository evidence priority over assumptions. Never invent behavior,
   status, relationships, procedures, terminology, or other facts to fill gaps
   or silence diagnostics.
2. Treat generated portals, builds, reports, and example output as derived
   artifacts, never as documentation sources to edit.
3. Never infer `$toudocu init` from missing files, first use, or an ordinary
   documentation request.
4. Treat `$toudocu init`, `$toudocu refresh`, `$toudocu refresh diff`, and
   translation workflows as agent workflows, not Toudocu Go CLI commands.
5. Run `task verify --run` only when the user explicitly requests execution of
   repository verification commands and the repository is trusted.
6. Never use configured translation roots as canonical documentation or backlog
   context. Read one only for an explicitly selected locale translation, check,
   find, build, run, or inspection operation.
7. Process Agent Feedback only through `toudocu agent next|respond`. Its
   operation reference owns validation and delivery; do not run ordinary
   checks, tests, or builds for feedback.
8. Create a durable work item only when the user or repository explicitly
   requires one, or substantial work needs durable scope, acceptance,
   verification, or handoff. Do not create one for an ordinary request or small
   local edit.

## Gather minimum evidence

Resolve or read paths, CLI, CI, glossary, standards, runbooks, and diagnostics
only when required by the current operation. Follow repository instructions,
start with the directly relevant sources, and expand evidence only when needed
for a reliable result.

An initial read-only check is optional when establishing a baseline for a large
change, existing diagnostics, a validation or CI failure, or an explicit user
request. Read-only review needs no check unless the answer depends on structural
diagnostics.

## Validate

Ordinary source-documentation mutations require the ordinary project check
unless the selected operation reference defines its own validation or delivery
policy. Run strict validation only when repository policy or the user requires
it, and build the portal only when requested or needed for verification.
